# What's this? 

This directory contains the source files of my bachelor thesis.
I write my bachelor thesis using LaTeX with the help of
[SJTU thesis template](https://github.com/weijianwen/sjtu-thesis-template-latex),
from which I use most of the format.

There some customized part by me:

* use ``bfseries`` for figure caption and table caption
* use a new banner for page header

All user guides can be found on the README.pdf.
